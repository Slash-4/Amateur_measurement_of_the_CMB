Partial reception of the experiment material, notably the SDR circuit and supporting element. With the 
components on hand, a more comprehensive analysis of the design could be made. It was realized that the 
LNA's which are a part of the microwave dish assembly are inadequate for the purpose of the experiment,
because they contain a filter for the emission line of hydrogen. This is still ok, because the gain of the 
LNB is 56-60dB and already contains an LNA, if ever this gain isn't enough we could make a request for a 
LNA which doesn't include a hydrogen line filter. But this piece missing would slow down our process.

Otherwise the components available are compatible with the experiment. The plan is to mount the 
SDR, the bias tee and the power supply to a cart then the computer will be able to sit on the cart and 
take the data from a usb cable. 

\\TODO: 1. Horn antenna assembly
\\TODO: 2. Receive and add bias tee and LNB to the circuit
\\TODO: 3. Get a hold of dewar flask and liquid nitrogen for cold load calibration

Received LNB and bias tee
Tested bias tee with voltmeter, revealed that bias tee lowers input voltage 12V 0.5A outputs 6.66VDC at 
RF+DC port, outputs 0.00V at RF port

Airspy r2 connects with software properly, measures environmental/system input as 0.4E-6 dB 

\\TODO: 1. Horn antenna assembly
\\TODO: 2. Dewar flask insulation foam and liquid nitrogen
\\TODO: 3. Connect bias tee to LNB

Tested software ingest system with the SDR, functions as expected. LNB and power supply ready to be used.
Horn antenna will be assembled today. The previous testing of the bias tee concluded that only 6V were going
into the system but this was an error because the voltmeter used was actually calibrated to display half 
the true voltage, the true voltage was actually 12V and the meter on the power suply is accurate to the load
delivered.

\\TODO: 1. Dewar flask
\\TODO: 2. Take measurements
